## 🚀 Overview

ARIY is an **interactive visualization tool** that demonstrates how **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** can solve the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.
It bridges the gap between **theory and practice** by allowing learners, educators, and researchers to **experiment with parameters**, observe ant traversal, and understand how **nature-inspired intelligence** solves complex optimization challenges.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional learning of metaheuristic algorithms is often abstract and difficult to visualize.

| Challenge                                  | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Understanding Metaheuristic Algorithms** | Algorithms like ACO are math-heavy and difficult to grasp.                       |
| **Lack of Interactive Tools**              | Most resources provide static or purely mathematical implementations.            |
| **Connecting Theory to Real-World**        | Learners struggle to apply optimization theory to logistics, AI, and networking. |
| **Experimenting with Parameters**          | Effects of α, β, ρ, and ant count are non-intuitive.                             |

👉 **ARIY solves this** by making ACO **visual, interactive, and learner-friendly**.

## 🔬 Mechanism – How It Works

1. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):** Find the shortest route that visits all nodes exactly once.
2. **Ant Colony Optimization:** Ants explore paths using pheromones + distance knowledge.
3. **Probability Rule:**

   - Ant chooses the next city based on pheromone level (α) and heuristic knowledge (β).

4. **Pheromone Update Rule:**

   - Pheromones evaporate (ρ) and are reinforced on shorter paths.

5. **Iterations:** After multiple rounds, near-optimal paths emerge.

You can **tweak parameters live**:

- 🐜 Ant population
- 💨 Evaporation rate (ρ)
- 🧭 Pheromone influence (α)
- 📏 Distance heuristic influence (β)
